DECam Toyz
=====================
These are some tools I'm developing to reduce my images taken with DECam. It is built on the
[Toyz for Data Reduction and Analysis](https://github.com/fred3m/toyz) framework, and is in 
no way affiliated with NOAO, DES, or DECam. It is still in its infancy, so stay tuned as it is
updated throughout the spring and summer.

In the future there will be more thorough documentation and a getting started tutorial.
For now see the Toyz [documentation](http://fred3m.github.io/toyz/).
